You are in PLAN MODE.

We are implementing a large, finalized feature using an immutable spec.

Authoritative documents:

- Execution index: docs/reviews/EXECUTION_INDEX.md
- Canonical specs: docs/reviews/spec/

Target:

- Phase {PHASE_NUMBER}

Rules:

- Do NOT write code
- Do NOT redesign architecture
- Do NOT add or remove scope
- Do NOT propose alternatives or optimizations
- Do NOT cross phase boundaries

Tasks:

1. Identify the exact tasks for Phase {PHASE_NUMBER} as defined in the execution index
2. Identify required inputs and assumptions from previous phases
3. Identify outputs produced by this phase
4. Identify risks or ambiguities that must be resolved before execution
5. Confirm whether the phase is executable as-is or blocked

Output format:

- Phase summary
- Inputs (required)
- Outputs (produced)
- Execution order (bullet list)
- Open questions (if any)

Stop after planning. Do NOT proceed to implementation.
