## Approval Criteria

Reviews should be **approved** if they meet ALL of the following criteria:

### 1. Product Relevance

- Review discusses the actual product being reviewed
- Mentions specific features, quality, or experiences with the product
- Relates to product functionality, aesthetics, or use cases

### 2. Substantive Content

- Provides meaningful information for other customers
- Contains specific details (e.g., "sturdy construction", "color matches photos", "easy assembly")
- Minimum length: At least 10 words of substantive content

### 3. Appropriate Language

- Professional and respectful tone
- Free from profanity or offensive language
- No personal attacks against staff or other customers

### 4. Authenticity

- Appears to be genuine customer experience
- Not suspiciously similar to other reviews
- No obvious copy-paste from other sources

### 5. Compliance

- Does not contain prohibited content (see rejection criteria below)
- Follows community standards

---

## Rejection Criteria

Reviews should be **rejected** (moved to trash) if they contain ANY of the following:

### 1. Promotional Content

- **External links** to other websites, stores, or services
- **Competitor mentions** with promotional intent
- **Self-promotion** or advertising of other products/services
- **Affiliate links** or referral codes

**Examples to reject:**

- "Check out BetterFurniture.com for similar items!"
- "I sell these on my website at..."
- "Use code SAVE20 at..."

### 2. Personal Information

- **Contact details**: Phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses
- **Social media handles** or requests to contact reviewer
- **Payment information** or transaction details

**Examples to reject:**

- "Email me at john@example.com for more info"
- "Follow me @johndoe for furniture tips"
- "Call me at 555-1234"

### 3. Off-Topic Content

- Not related to the product being reviewed
- Discusses shipping, customer service, or website issues (redirect to support)
- Political, religious, or social commentary unrelated to product

**Examples to reject:**

- Review of Chair A posted on Product B
- "Your website is hard to navigate" (support issue, not product review)
- Political statements unrelated to furniture

### 4. Abusive or Inappropriate Language

- Profanity or vulgar language
- Hate speech, discrimination, or harassment
- Threats or violent content
- Sexually explicit content

### 5. Fraudulent or Misleading

- **Fake reviews**: Suspiciously positive/negative with no specifics
- **Duplicate content**: Exact copy of another review
- **Incentivized reviews**: Mentions compensation for review
- **Competitor sabotage**: Patterns suggesting false negative reviews

**Examples to reject:**

- "This is the best product ever!!!!!" (no details, excessive punctuation)
- "Terrible, don't buy" (no explanation)
- "I got this for free in exchange for my review"

## Spam Indicators

Mark reviews as **spam** (instead of trash) if they exhibit multiple spam characteristics:

### Red Flags

- ✗ Generic text that could apply to any product
- ✗ Excessive capitalization or punctuation (!!!!, CAPS LOCK)
- ✗ Repeating the same phrase multiple times
- ✗ Randomly generated text or nonsensical content
- ✗ Multiple reviews from same user with identical/similar text
- ✗ Suspicious patterns (e.g., 5+ reviews submitted within minutes)
- ✗ External links embedded in review text

### Spam Examples

- "AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!! MUST BUY NOW!!!!"
- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..." (placeholder text)
- "Great great great great great" (repetitive, no detail)
- Multiple reviews: "Nice product", "Good product", "Fine product" (generic pattern)

---

## Editing Guidelines

### When to Edit Reviews

**Minor edits are acceptable** to improve readability while preserving reviewer intent:

✓ **Allowed edits:**

- Fix obvious typos or spelling errors
- Correct minor grammatical issues
- Remove excessive punctuation (e.g., "Great!!!!!" → "Great!")
- Format line breaks for readability

✗ **Not allowed:**

- Changing the meaning or sentiment of the review
- Adding or removing product-specific details
- Altering the star rating
- Removing constructive criticism

### Editing Process

1. **Hover over review** in Comments list → Click "Quick Edit"
2. Make minimal necessary changes
3. **Add internal note** in comment meta: "Edited: [reason]" (for audit trail)
4. **Do not notify reviewer** of minor typo corrections

### When NOT to Edit

If a review requires substantial changes to meet approval criteria, **reject it instead** of heavily editing. Examples:

- Removing entire sentences of off-topic content
- Rewriting vague statements to add specifics
- Changing tone from negative to positive (or vice versa)

**Principle:** Preserve authentic customer voice. If editing would significantly change the review, reject it.

## Edge Cases & Special Situations

### Mixed Reviews (Positive + Negative)

**Action:** Approve if both aspects are substantive and relevant

- Example: "Love the design but assembly was difficult" → ✓ Approve

### Low Star Rating with Detailed Feedback

**Action:** Approve if meets all approval criteria

- Negative reviews are valuable when constructive
- Example: "1 star - Legs wobble despite tightening. Quality issue." → ✓ Approve

### High Star Rating with No Details

**Action:** Approve if sufficient context, reject if spam-like

- "5 stars - Exactly as described, fast shipping" → ✓ Approve (minimal but acceptable)
- "5 stars - Best ever!!!" → ✗ Reject (no substance)

### Verified vs. Non-Verified Purchases

**Action:** Apply same criteria to both

- Verified badge adds credibility but doesn't change moderation standards
- Non-verified reviews approved if they meet all criteria

### Questions in Reviews

**Action:** Approve if review contains substantive feedback + question

- "Great chair, but does it come in blue?" → ✓ Approve (treat as review with question)
- "Does this come in other colors?" (no review content) → ✗ Reject (not a review)

### Comparisons to Competitors

**Action:** Approve if not promotional, reject if advertising competitor

- "Better quality than IKEA alternatives" → ✓ Approve (comparison without promotion)
- "Just buy from CompetitorName instead" → ✗ Reject (promoting competitor)

### Requests for Product Changes

**Action:** Approve if framed as feedback, log separately for product team

- "Would love a version with adjustable height" → ✓ Approve + forward to product team
- Treat as valuable customer insight
